Configuration of the database,  
The database used is mysql, we use the driver sequelize for it ORM management.  
Use the dot file .env from this folder to set the configuration.

example:
    
    DB_HOSTNAME="localhost"
    DB_USERNAME="root"
    DB_PASSWORD="root"
    DB_PORT="3306"
    DB_DATABASE="database_name"
    
This .env file is naturally ignored by git.
